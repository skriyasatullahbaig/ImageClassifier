**Dataset and Model Visualization: Multi-Label Classification for Domestic Cats and Dogs**  

This project includes a robust dataset of annotated images and a pre-trained multi-label classification model, all accessible and visualized on the same page. The model complements the dataset by demonstrating real-world application and performance.  

### Dataset Overview:  
The dataset contains high-quality images of domestic cats and dogs, each labeled with multi-label annotations for:  
- **Species Identification**: "Cat" and/or "Dog" labels, allowing single or overlapping classifications.  
- **Physical Traits**: Attributes like coat color (e.g., "black," "white"), patterns (e.g., "spotted," "striped"), and fur type (e.g., "fluffy").  
- **Contextual Settings**: Labels for indoor or outdoor environments.  

### Model Features:  
- **Trained on the Dataset**: The included model was trained on this dataset, showcasing its capability to identify multiple features in a single image.  
- **Interactive Visualization**: Users can upload images or explore predictions directly on the project page. The model's outputs are displayed alongside corresponding ground truth labels.  
- **High Accuracy**: Demonstrates reliable performance in distinguishing between cats, dogs, and their attributes under diverse scenarios.  

### Project Highlights:  
- **Integrated Learning and Visualization**: Seamlessly access the dataset and trained model in one place for a comprehensive understanding.  
- **Interactive Exploration**: Real-time prediction and comparison against labeled data for hands-on insights.  
- **Application Potential**: Ideal for research, development, and deployment of multi-label classifiers in pet identification systems and more.
